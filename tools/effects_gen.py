"""effects_gen.py — bake Aurora-authored effect scenes into generated `.emp`.

Scanline-services **P5**. This is the aeon consumer half of the Aurora effects
contract; the NORMATIVE read set it is built to is `tools/EFFECTS_CONSUMER_CONTRACT.md`
§2 — *"P5 implements exactly this and nothing more"*. Do not grow a reader for a field
that section does not list: adding one is a CONTRACT change that amends that file and
the empyrean schema pair in the same series, and Aurora re-pins its writer golden.

SLICE 1 (this commit) — discovery, load posture, and SHAPE validation only. Emission
of the generated module, the per-section binding labels and the `act_descriptor.emp`
import seam are later slices; the seam in particular waits on design Q-c (wave-1 design
§9), which is an open decision and not one to settle silently inside an implementation.

Validation posture (scanline design §7, contract §2.1, restated because it is the whole
architecture of this tool): the generator validates **SHAPE** — schema version, id,
unknown keys — and refuses rather than guessing. Authored **VALUES** are validated by
sigil when the generated `.emp` calls the real `scene()` / `layer()` constructors, whose
`ensure` text is the v1 error surface. This tool must never grow a value check that
duplicates a constructor guard: two sources for one rule is how they drift.

Error handling (contract §3, normative): aeon consumers **fail loud**. Bare `json.load`
plus direct subscripting, exactly the `inject_editor_bg.py:58-61` reference posture — a
malformed input raises, the build STOPS, and nothing is written back over the input. No
tolerate-garbage path, no repair path. Note the asymmetry the contract calls out: a
MISSING scene directory is legitimately "no editor scenes" and is not an error, while an
UNREADABLE file fails the bake. "Degrade gracefully" must not collapse those two.
